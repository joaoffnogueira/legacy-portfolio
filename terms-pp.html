                        João F. F. Nogueira built the Purple Places app as

                        João F. F. Nogueira at no cost and is intended for use as
                        is.

                        policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                        Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                      </p> <p>
                        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                        the collection and use of information in relation to this
                        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                        used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                        anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                      </p> <p>
                        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                        as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at

                        For a better experience, while using our Service, I

                          The app does use third-party services that may collect

                        I want to inform you that whenever you
                        use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                        I collect data and information (through third-party
                        products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                        include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                        configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                        statistics.
                      </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                        to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                        stored on your device's internal memory.
                      </p> <p>
                        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                        the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                        “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                        You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                        and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                        choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                        portions of this Service.
                      </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                        I may employ third-party companies and
                        individuals due to the following reasons:
                      </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                        I want to inform users of this Service
                        that these third parties have access to their Personal
                        Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                      </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                        I value your trust in providing us your
                        Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                        a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                        that these external sites are not operated by me.
                        Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                        Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                        no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,

                          These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                          I do not knowingly collect personally
                          identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                          I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                          me with personal information, I immediately
                          delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                          and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                          personal information, please contact me so that
                          I will be able to do the necessary actions.

                      <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                        allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                        our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                        to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                        versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                        database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                        to it, still belong to João F. F. Nogueira.
                      </p> <p>
                        João F. F. Nogueira is committed to ensuring that the app is
                        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                      </p> <p>
                        The Purple Places app stores and processes personal data that
                        you have provided to us, to provide my
                        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                        official operating system of your device. It could make your
                        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                        that the Purple Places app won’t work properly or at all.

                        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                        João F. F. Nogueira will not take responsibility for. Certain
                        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                        by your mobile network provider, but João F. F. Nogueira
                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                        have any of your data allowance left.
                      </p> <p></p> <p>
                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                        should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                        other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                      </p> <p>
                        Along the same lines, João F. F. Nogueira cannot always take
                        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                        João F. F. Nogueira cannot accept responsibility.
                      </p> <p>
                        With respect to João F. F. Nogueira’s responsibility for your
                        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                        bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                        to you. João F. F. Nogueira accepts no liability for any
                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                      </p> <p>
                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                        currently available on Android – the requirements for the 
                        system(and for any additional systems we
                        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. João F. F. Nogueira does not promise that it
                        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android version that you have
                        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                        from your device.
